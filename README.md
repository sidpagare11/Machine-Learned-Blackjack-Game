How to run this project:

1.(Activate virtual environment if wanted)

2. Navigate to the python directory (when ran, should only contain python files, and the directory should be inside "blackjack_project"
   
3. Install numpy, scipy, pandas, scikit-learn, joblib

  
4. Train the model by running: python3 q_learning_blackjack.py
   
5. Return to the main directory (blackjack_project)
   
6. Run "make clean" to cleanup any previous files
   
7. Compile project using "make"
   
8. Run the projec with "make run"

You will then be able to play the game with the machine learned model's input given to you for each of your turns. You can periodically retrain the model after playing several hands in order to improve its accuracy.
